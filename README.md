**News**  
13-June-2014 - Airprobe-hopping ported from gnuradio 3.6 to gnuradio 3.7. Users of gnuradio 3.6 can use v1.0 tag to get the older sourcecode. The new code compiles and run but does not decode anything yet, probably due to changes in gr API - work in progress  
16-June-2014 - Airprobe-hopping is working now on gnuradio 3.7. Debug messages are enabled by default now.
